# Mock Messages

Used for mock HTTP Restful server as well as sending mock messages to PubNub for testing.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Storing the keys

As a good practice, we're not going to store the in GitHub.
Even locally we don't want to leave it as plain text.
We're going to encrypt it instead.

Create ``.env`` and put that into in the same directory as this README.
**DO NOT** check this into git. ``.gitigore`` should prevent that anyway.

The content should be:

```
export PUB_NUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY=the_subscription_key
export PUB_NUB_PUBLISH_KEY=the_pubish_key
```

You can get those keys from your PubNub account and use the below command to encrypt it.

```
python -c "from crypto import encrypt; print(encrypt('My secret key'))"
```

Note: this is only for a our mock server. In production we'll recommend that you encrypt it using AWS KMS,
Vault or other services where there are key rotation and other more advanced security.

## Running

First make sure the environment variables are setup:

```
source .env
```

They run the script below

```
python mock_server.py
```

### Initial State

To get the initial state. This represent the current state of the screen used when the UI first initialises. 

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/initial_state 
```

Example output: 

```
{"subscription_info":{"subscribe_key":"sub-c-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX","user_id":"my_custom_user_id","channel":"dev-checkin"},"current_event":{"id":"event-1","title":"BJJ","description":"BJJ Fundamentals","start_time":"18:00","end_time":"19:30","icon":"http://127.0.0.1:8765/static/images/bjj.png","icon_type":"url"},"next_event":{"id":"event-2","title":"Muay Thai","description":"Muay Thai","start_time":"19:30","end_time":"21:00","icon":"http://127.0.0.1:8765/static/images/muaythai.png","icon_type":"url"},"attendees":[{"event_id":"event-1","user-id":"user0001","name":"Jack Sparrow","icon":"person_check","icon_type":"material","reward":"","status":"signedup"},{"event_id":"event-1","user-id":"user0002","name":"Will Turner","icon":"person_check","icon_type":"material","reward":"","status":"checkedin"},{"event_id":"event-1","user-id":"user0008","name":"Roger Gracie","icon":"person_check","icon_type":"material","reward":"ðŸ¥‹","status":"signedup"}]}
```

### Get Event By ID

As we can see above, check ins are associated with events. The UI can request information about the event.

```
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8765/event?event_id=event-1"
```

Example output:

```
{"id":"event-1","title":"BJJ","description":"BJJ Fundamentals","start_time":"18:00","end_time":"19:30","icon":"bjj","icon_type":"internal"} 
```

On top of the Restful service the mocker server provides, it also pumps out messages to PubNub.

The below are example outputs in the terminal of messages being publishes on intervals.

The ``initial_state`` request will include additional check ins if the UI requests for it
(i.e. refreshing the webpage).


### Get Current Event

To get the event of the current class

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/current_event
```

Example Output:

```
{
  "id": "event-1",
  "title": "BJJ",
  "description": "BJJ Fundamentals",
  "start_time": "18:00",
  "end_time": "19:30",
  "icon_type": "url",
  "icon": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/static/images/bjj.png"
}
```

Notice the ``icon_type`` is ``url`` so the icon is a valid URL where the icon is served.
You can go ahead and open the below URL to see the icon.

http://127.0.0.1:8765/static/images/bjj.png

### Get Next Event

To get the event of the current class

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/next_event
```

Example Output:

```
{
  "id": "event-2",
  "title": "Muay Thai",
  "description": "Muay Thai",
  "start_time": "19:30",
  "end_time": "21:00",
  "icon": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/static/images/muaythai.png",
  "icon_type": "url"
}
```

## Schema

Both initial state and messages sent to PubNub topic looks like this

  * event_id - The event id of the class which can be requested for more details from the request server
  * user-id - A unique user id which should not be email address or anything that would give away confidential information about the real person.
  * name - The name of the member, but should be an alias that the user has agree to display. Could just be a first name or some other nick name.
  * icon - The icon to be displayed. The value would depend on icon_type
  * icon_type - The icon type, it can take the following values: ``url``, ``material`` or ``internal``
  * reward - The club can give rewards like most number of classes attended etc... typically this is a set of emojis.
  * status - It can take the following values:
    * signedup - User has signed up on the app but not physically at the gym
    * checkedin - User has checked in at the gym
    * cancelled - User has cancelled their signup up which can be done on the app. But once check in has happened user cannot cancel that.
