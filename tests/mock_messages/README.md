# Mock Messages

Used for mock HTTP Restful server as well as sending mock messages to PubNub for testing.

##Â Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Storing the keys

As a good practice, we're not going to store the in GitHub.
Even locally we don't want to leave it as plain text.
We're going to encrypt it instead.

Create ``.env`` and put that into in the same directory as this README.
**DO NOT** check this into git. ``.gitigore`` should prevent that anyway.

The content should be:

```
export PUB_NUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY=the_subscription_key
export PUB_NUB_PUBLISH_KEY=the_pubish_key
```

You can get those keys from your PubNub account and use the below command to encrypt it.

```
python -c "from crypto import encrypt; print(encrypt('My secret key'))"
```

Note: this is only for a our mock server. In production we'll recommend that you encrypt it using AWS KMS,
Vault or other services where there are key rotation and other more advanced security.


## Running

First make sure the environment variables are setup:

```
source .env
```

They run the script below

```
python mock_server.py
```

To get the initial state. This represent the current state of the screen used when the UI first initialises. 

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/initial_state 
```

Example output: 

```
[{"event_id":"event-1","name":"Jack Sparrow","icon":"person_check","icon_type":"material","reward":""},{"event_id":"event-1","name":"Will Turner","icon":"person_check","icon_type":"material","reward":""}] 
```

As we can see above, check ins are associated with events. The UI can request information about the event.

```
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8765/event?event_id=event-1"
```

Example output:

```
{"id":"event-1","title":"BJJ","description":"BJJ Fundamentals","start_time":"18:00","end_time":"19:30","icon":"bjj","icon_type":"internal"} 
```

On top of the Restful service the mocker server provides, it also pumps out messages to PubNub.

The below are example outputs in the terminal of messages being publishes on intervals.

The ``initial_state`` request will include additional check ins if the UI requests for it
(i.e. refreshing the webpage).
