# Logo Processing

A convenient tool to downsize logo.

Generally we want to keep the full size logo and use this to get a good size for the UI.

##Â Install

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Example

See ``resize.py`` which generates various resolutions
(feel free to add a resolution that works best on the screen).

We can then copy the desired size like this:

```
cp logos/ak-logo-480x480.png ../../public/ak-logo.png
```
